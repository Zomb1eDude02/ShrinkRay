### Shrink Ray (.NET)
Shrink your enemies with the Shrink Ray Mod!

Place ShrinkRay.dll in *GameRoot*\scripts\
It should look like *GameRoot*\scripts\ShrinkRay.dll

Currently there is no config (will be implemented soon)

Controls:\
F9: Get Shrink Ray (High Roller Revolver)\
Z: Shrink person you are aiming at (People Only)

Requires:
[ScriptHookRDR2 .NET](https://github.com/Saltyq/ScriptHookRDR2DotNet/releases)

### Special Thanks
Slinky, DireDan, ShawnPR1, and Dot.

Without them this mod would've probably never been completed!
